# ZeroPlayM4
An AI agent learning to master compelling games through MuZero-style self-play, developed and optimized for MacBook Pro M4.

## Summary

This project aims to build and train an AI agent, based on MuZero principles, that learns to master games (like classic board games or Atari) entirely through self-play. The system utilizes an open-source MuZero implementation, adapted and run on a MacBook Pro M4 (Apple Silicon), leveraging libraries like PyTorch/TensorFlow with Metal acceleration. The goal is to explore and showcase model-based reinforcement learning techniques where the AI learns the game's rules and optimal strategies on its own.
